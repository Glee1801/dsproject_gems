## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(readr)
COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses <- read_csv("COVID-19 Survey Student Responses.csv")
View(COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r libraries}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(maps)          
library(ggmap)
library(RColorBrewer)  # for color palettes
library(sf)            # for working with spatial data
library(leaflet)       # for highly customizable mapping
library(ggthemes)      # for more themes (including theme_map())
library(plotly)        # for the ggplotly() - basic interactivity
library(gganimate)     # for adding animation layers to ggplots
library(transformr)
library(ggimage)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```



```{r}

library(readr)
dataset <- read_csv("Data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(AgeCat = cut(Age, breaks = c(0,13,18,23,33,45,60), labels = c("0-13", "13-18", "18-23", "23-33", "33-45", "45-60"))) %>%
  mutate(avgsleep = mean(Sleep)) %>% 
  mutate(SocialCat = cut_number(SocialMedia, n = 3))
  
#labels = "0-1", "1-3", "3-10" label social media 

View(dataset)

# mutate(AgeCat = cut_interval(Age, n = 6))

```

```{r}

```{r}

       x = "", 
       y = "")
```

```


```{r}

  scale_color_viridis_d()
  

#boxplot only one that shows y values correctly (not in 100s like geom_col)
# doesn't show differences in media use though 

```

```{r}

  group_by(SocialMedia, avgsleep, AgeCat, Sleep) %>%
  summarise(avgmedia = mean(SocialMedia)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = avgmedia, 
             y = avgsleep,

        plot.title.position= "plot", 
        legend.position = "none")+
  scale_color_viridis_d()


#use AgeCat to graph?
#add line of best fit?
#overall, increased media use seems to = less sleep 
#won't show avg sleep and seems to show a cumulative or sum of sleep ?

```






Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
