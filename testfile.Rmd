## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(readr)
COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses <- read_csv("COVID-19 Survey Student Responses.csv")
View(COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r libraries}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(maps)          
library(ggmap)
library(RColorBrewer)  # for color palettes
library(sf)            # for working with spatial data
library(leaflet)       # for highly customizable mapping
library(ggthemes)      # for more themes (including theme_map())
library(plotly)        # for the ggplotly() - basic interactivity
library(gganimate)     # for adding animation layers to ggplots
library(transformr)
library(ggimage)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```



```{r}

library(readr)
dataset <- read_csv("Data.csv")
View(dataset)

```

```{r}
newdataest<- dataset %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  mutate(avgsleep = mean(Sleep))

```

```{r}

newdataset<- as.data.frame(newdataest)

```



```{r}

             y = avgclasstime, 
             color = HealthIssue)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Connection))+
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "", 
       title = "Average Amount of Hours Spent in Class by Age")
```


```{r}

  scale_color_viridis_d()
  

#boxplot only one that shows y values correctly (not in 100s like geom_col)
# doesn't show differences in media use though 

```

```{r}

  group_by(SocialMedia, avgsleep, AgeCat, Sleep) %>%
  summarise(avgmedia = mean(SocialMedia)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = avgmedia,

        plot.title.position= "plot", 
        legend.position = "none")+
  scale_color_viridis_d()


#use AgeCat to graph?
#add line of best fit?
#overall, increased media use seems to = less sleep 
#won't show avg sleep and seems to show a cumulative or sum of sleep ?

```






Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
