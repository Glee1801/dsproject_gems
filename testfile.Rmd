## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(readr)
COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses <- read_csv("COVID-19 Survey Student Responses.csv")
View(COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r libraries}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(maps)          
library(ggmap)
library(RColorBrewer)  # for color palettes
library(sf)            # for working with spatial data
library(leaflet)       # for highly customizable mapping
library(ggthemes)      # for more themes (including theme_map())
library(plotly)        # for the ggplotly() - basic interactivity
library(gganimate)     # for adding animation layers to ggplots
library(transformr)
library(ggimage)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```



```{r}

library(readr)
COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses <- read_csv("COVID-19 Survey Student Responses.csv")
View(COVID_19_Survey_Student_Responses)

```

```{r}
newdataest<- dataset %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  mutate(avgsleep = mean(Sleep))

newdataest

```

```{r}

newdataset<- as.data.frame(newdataest)

```



```{r}


newdataest %>%
  group_by(Age, HealthIssue, Connection) %>%
  summarise(avgclasstime = mean(OnlineClass)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age,
             y = avgclasstime, 
             color = HealthIssue)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Connection))+
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "", 
       title = "Average Amount of Hours Spent in Class by Age")
```


```{r}
newdataest %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ClassRating)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = ClassRating)) +
  facet_wrap("ClassMedium") +
  labs(title = "Average Class Rating by Course Medium", 
       x = "", 
       y = "")
```



```{r}

newdataest<- dataset %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  mutate(avgsleep = mean(Sleep))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = OnlineClass)) +
  geom_col() +
  # facet_wrap(vars(Age)) +
  labs(title = "Connection With Loved Ones", 
       subtitle = "Students Who Find Themselves More Connected with Family, Close Friends, and Relatives")

newdataest

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
